        <h2><center><u>Importance of Mental Health</center></u></h2>
        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;"> Mental health is the foundation upon which we build our lives, influencing every aspect of our existence. It shapes how we perceive the world, interact with others, and navigate the challenges that come our way. Just as physical health is vital for the body's well-being, mental health is essential for our emotional resilience and overall quality of life. Good mental health enables us to cope with stress, maintain fulfilling relationships, and pursue our goals with clarity and purpose. When neglected, mental health issues can have far-reaching consequences, impacting not only the individual but also their loved ones and society as a whole. By prioritizing mental health and seeking support when needed, we can cultivate a happier, more resilient, and compassionate world for ourselves and those around us.</p>
